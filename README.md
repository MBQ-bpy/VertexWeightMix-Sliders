# VertexWeightMix-Sliders
 This add-on allows you to access the influence of Vertex Weight Mix modifiers in Blender, even when they are collapsed.

# Why is this needed
 Many modifiers in Blender can be masked by a Vertex Group.  
 The Vertex Weight Mix modifier is particularly useful for animating the Vertex Groups used in such masks.  
 However, I've found that this modifier occupies excessive space in the UI.  
 To address this issue, I've created a panel that lists the influences of the Vertex Weight Mix modifier in a more compact, collapsed form.
